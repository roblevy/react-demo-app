# Functions Lab

## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

Let's practice writing some functions!

## Exercise

#### Requirements

Follow the requirements in the list below:

1. Define a function `maxOfTwoNumbers` that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. Use the if-then-else construct available in Javascript. Do some Googling to figure this out if you forget how conditionals work.
2. Define a function `maxOfThree` that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them.
3. Write a function `isCharacterAVowel` that takes a character (i.e. a string of length 1) and returns true if it is a vowel and false, otherwise.
4. Define a function `sumArray` and a function `multiplyArray` that sums and multiplies (respectively) all the numbers in an array of numbers. For example, `sumArray([1,2,3,4])` should return 10, and `multiplyArray([1,2,3,4])` should return 24.
5. Write a function that returns the number of arguments passed to the function when called.
6. Define a function `reverseString` that reverses a string. For example, reverseString("jag testar") should return the string "ratset gaj".
7. Write a function `findLongestWord` that takes an array of words and returns the length of the longest word in the array.
8. Write a function `filterLongWords` that takes an array of words and a number `i` and returns a new array of words that are longer than `i` characters long.
