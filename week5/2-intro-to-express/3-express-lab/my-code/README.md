# Express lab

Make an express app, which listens for HTTP requests on port 4000.

The app should respond to GET requests to 'localhost:4000' with a home page.

In response to a GET request to 'localhost:4000/about' it should display a simple about page.

'localhost:4000/data' should return a ul with a set of li's each of which are decided by the values in an array.

## Bonus task

e.g. ['banana', 'grape', 'peach']
```
<ul>
  <li>banana</li>
  <li>grape</li>
  <li>peach</li>
</ul>
```
