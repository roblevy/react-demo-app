# WDI 37 Student Classwork Repository

Welcome to the GA London WDI 37 student classwork repository. Using this repository, we're going to distribute `starter-code` for lessons. It's also a place for you to keep a record of all of the work you do in lessons.

## Setup

### Step 1. Fork the repository

First, [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) this repository by clicking the fork button.

Choose to fork this repository to your account (only relevant if you are a member of an organisation).

### Step 2. Clone your fork

Next, clone your fork to your local machine by copying the SSH from your repository. 

![clone](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/40461/10177745/b394027e-66f3-11e5-8cc5-20c01c9a7785.png)

Navigate to your development directory:

```bash
cd ~/development
```

And run the command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:<student-github-name>/wdi-ldn-26-classwork.git
```

### Step 3. Setup the upstream

In order for you to connect your locally cloned fork to the original repository on github, we need to add a new `remote` for this `upstream` (this is the convention for the name of the original repository).

Let's go and grab the SSH for that original repository.

Now make sure that you're in your locally cloned fork of your classwork and type:

```bash
git remote add upstream git@github.com:ga-students/wdi-ldn-26-classwork.git
```

## Fetching starter-code

At the start of each lesson, the instructor may upload some starter-code to this repository. 

The structure of this code will look like this:

```
.
├── README.md
└── example-lesson
   └── my-code 
       └── code.txt
```

In order to fetch this new code, you will need to run:

```bash
git pull upstream master
```

You can now work in this `starter-code` directory.


## Backing up your work

You don't have the privileges to push changes to the `upstream` but it's a good idea to push your changes to your local fork, for which you do have privileges.

You should commit regularly and push as you would with any other project.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Finished example lesson"
git push origin master
```

## Fetching 'solution' code
At the end of some days, we will add some kind of 'solution code' here so that you have a reference of a 'best practice' way of solving the day's challenges.

The structure of this code will look like this:

```
.
├── README.md
└── example-lesson
   └── my-code 
       └── code.txt
   └── solution-code 
       └── code.txt
```
