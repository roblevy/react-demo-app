  <h1>Github merge conflicts</h1>
  <p>The basic idea is to:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Find out which files have conflicts</li>
    <li>Open each file, one at a time, in Atom</li>
    <li>Make the file look right: either delete my changes, or delete yours, or keep a combination of the two</li>
    <li>Commit the finished file</li>
  </ol>
