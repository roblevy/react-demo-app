## HTML Forms

Create a new html document `index.html`:

```bash
$ touch index.html
```

Open the folder in `atom`:

```bash
$ atom .
```

Now add some HTML boilerplate code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>HTML Forms</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

Right click on anywhere in the HTML file and click 'Open in Browser' to see your work in Chrome. Refresh the page (`cmd + r`) whenever you have made changes to your file (don't forget to save first!)

Create the following form using the correct elements. Ensure that the form is pre-populated as shown in the image on page load.
