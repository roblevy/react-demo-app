## Style using Classes and IDs - Independent Practice (10 mins)

Using what we've done in class, see how far you can get through these exercises in 10 minutes:

1. make an unordered HTML list of the following animals:  

	- mouse  
	- canary  
	- penguin  
	- salmon  
	- cat  
	- goldfish  
	- dog  
	- sheep  
	- parakeet  
	- tuna  

2. using CSS classes do the following:

	- underline all of the mammals
	- make all the birds italic
	- make all the fish bold

3. using IDs apply the following colors:

	- make the mouse grey
	- make the goldfish gold
	- make the sheep steelBlue

If you aren't how to do something, use Google, for example, "How to underline text using CSS".
